# Session 7 — 2026-02-22

## Context
- **Phase**: Phase 2-5 Quality Enhancement
- **Branch**: N/A

## Objectives
- [x] Apply Phase 1 spec-panel improvements to Phases 2-5

## Work Done

### Phase 2 (Safety Integration)
- Enhanced with quantified criteria + Protocol, Definition of Done, 18-test suite (4 files), 3 worked examples, pinned versions, reproducibility protocol, time buffers

### Phase 2.5 (BarrierNet Experiment)
- Added Definition of Done, time buffer note, pinned versions + reproducibility (already had 30+ tests)

### Phase 3 (Partial Observability + Self-Play)
- Enhanced with quantified criteria + Protocol, Definition of Done, 15-test suite (4 files), 3 worked examples, pinned versions, reproducibility protocol, time buffers on all 8 sessions

### Phase 4 (Sim-to-Real Transfer)
- Enhanced with Protocol columns (7 hard requirements), How to Measure for soft targets, Definition of Done (10 criteria), 18-test suite (4 files), 3 worked examples, pinned versions, reproducibility protocol

### Phase 5 (Analysis & Publication)
- Enhanced with Protocol columns on all 4 phase gates, How to Measure for key metrics, Definition of Done (10 criteria), Phase Gate Checklist, 15-test suite (4 files), 3 worked examples, pinned versions, reproducibility protocol
