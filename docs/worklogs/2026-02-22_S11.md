# Session 11 — 2026-02-22

## Context
- **Phase**: Phase 1: Simulation Foundation — Session 1 (Project Scaffolding & Environment Core)
- **Branch**: main

## Objectives
- [x] Create project directory structure
- [x] Implement unicycle dynamics (dynamics.py)
- [x] Implement core PE environment (pursuit_evasion_env.py)
- [x] Implement observation builder (observations.py)
- [x] Implement reward computer (rewards.py)
- [x] Implement wrappers (wrappers.py)
- [x] Implement pygame renderer (rendering.py)
- [x] Implement safety stubs (safety_filter.py, cbf.py)
- [x] Create requirements.txt
- [x] Write unit tests for dynamics and environment

## Work Done

### Project Structure
- Created full directory tree per Phase 1 spec

### Unicycle Dynamics
- Euler integration with angle wrapping
- Arena wall clipping with velocity zeroing

### Core Environment
- Gymnasium-compatible PursuitEvasionEnv with dual-action step API
- Random initialization with minimum separation constraint
- Capture detection and timeout handling

### Observation, Reward, Rendering, Wrappers, Safety Stubs
- All implemented per Phase 1 spec

## Files Changed
| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Multiple | Created | Full project scaffolding — see below |

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Start locally on Mac | GPU not required for Phase 1; faster dev cycle |
| Follow spec precisely | Established engineering standards — no shortcuts |

## Issues & Blockers
| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| None yet | — |

## Next Steps
- [ ] Session 2: Observation & reward design refinement
- [ ] Validate env passes gymnasium check_env()
