# Session 46 — 2026-02-24

## Context
- **Phase**: Phase 3: Adversarial Self-Play + Curriculum
- **Branch**: N/A (research session)

## Objectives
- [x] Research state-of-the-art approaches for fixing collapse in adversarial self-play training
- [x] Cover 6 specific topics: OpenAI Hide-and-Seek, asymmetric self-play, PBT, curriculum design, FSP/PSRO, exploitability-based curriculum
- [x] Produce actionable research report with applicability analysis for our pursuit-evasion setting

## Work Done

### Web Research on Self-Play Collapse Prevention
Conducted extensive web search across 6 major topic areas with 15+ search queries, covering:
1. OpenAI Hide-and-Seek (Baker et al., 2019) training details
2. Asymmetric self-play algorithms (MASP, training ratios)
3. Population-based training (Czempin & Gleave 2022, AlphaStar league)
4. Curriculum design (PAIRED, subgame curriculum, autocurricula)
5. FSP/PSRO frameworks (Heinrich & Silver 2016, Lanctot et al. 2017)
6. Exploitability descent (Lockhart et al. 2019) and regret-based methods

### Research Report
Compiled comprehensive research report with 6 approaches, each analyzed for:
- Core mechanism preventing collapse
- Application to our pursuit-evasion setting
- Implementation complexity
- Expected effectiveness

## Files Changed
| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `docs/worklogs/2026-02-24_S46.md` | Created | This worklog |
| `docs/research_self_play_collapse_prevention.md` | Created | Comprehensive research report (20 papers, 6 approaches, 10 sections) |

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Focus on practical applicability | Each approach evaluated specifically for our 1v1 PE setting with obstacles |
| Prioritize approaches by implementation complexity | Help guide which fixes to try first |

## Issues & Blockers
| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| None | N/A |

## Next Steps
- [ ] Implement recommended fixes (starting with easiest: dual-criteria curriculum + asymmetric training)
- [ ] Consider PAIRED-style environment design for obstacle placement
- [ ] Evaluate whether population-based approach is worth the compute cost
