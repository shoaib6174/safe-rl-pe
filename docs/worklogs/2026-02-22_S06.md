# Session 6 — 2026-02-22

## Context
- **Phase**: Phase 1 Specification Review
- **Branch**: N/A

## Objectives
- [x] Expert Spec Panel Review of Phase 1 specification
- [x] Resolve all identified issues
- [x] Research SB3 reproducibility protocol

## Work Done

### Expert Spec Panel Review
- Conducted review with 5 expert personas (Wiegers, Fowler, Nygard, Crispin, Adzic)
- Identified 3 critical, 5 high-priority, 6 medium-priority issues

### Issue Resolution (All 14 resolved)
- **C1**: Unit tests elevated to must-have (15+ tests defined)
- **C2**: Locked SB3 + Option B (custom wrapper) decisions
- **C3**: Quantified all qualitative acceptance criteria
- **H1**: Added 4 concrete worked examples (capture, obs, reward, self-play)
- **H2**: Added Phase 2 integration interfaces (SafetyFilter, RewardComputer, ObservationBuilder)
- **H3**: Added self-play health monitoring (entropy, diversity, rollback)
- **H4**: Added 6 VCP-CBF numerical edge case tests
- **H5**: Config YAML elevated to must-have
- **M1-M6**: Definition of Done, seed protocol, architecture split, K_p=3.0, time buffers, version pinning

### SB3 Reproducibility Research
- Researched SB3 reproducibility protocol (Appendix B added)

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| SB3 + custom wrapper (Option B) | Better control over PE-specific logic |
| Unit tests as must-have | Critical for Phase 2 integration confidence |
| Quantified acceptance criteria | Removes ambiguity from pass/fail |

## Files Changed
| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `docs/phases/phase1_*.md` | Modified | All 14 issues resolved |
| `docs/pathway/pathway_A.md` | Modified | Updated with decisions |
| `docs/spec_panel_review_report.md` | Created | Review findings |

## Metrics
- Phase 1 spec quality: 7.5/10 -> 8.8/10
- Issues resolved: 14/14

## Next Steps
- [ ] Apply Phase 1 quality improvements to Phases 2-5
