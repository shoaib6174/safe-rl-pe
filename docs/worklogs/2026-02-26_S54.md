# Session 54 — 2026-02-26

## Context
- **Phase**: Phase 3 — Design Fundamentals Research
- **Branch**: N/A (research only)

## Objectives
- [x] Research how other PE RL projects set up their games
- [x] Investigate arena size, speed ratio, episode length, capture radius
- [x] Investigate reward design, curriculum learning, starting conditions, action space
- [x] Address the "trivial equilibrium" problem for bounded-domain equal-speed PE

## Work Done

### Web Research: PE RL Design Choices Survey
Conducted comprehensive web search across 30+ papers and implementations from 2020-2026 to benchmark our fundamental design choices against the broader PE RL literature. Compiled findings into a detailed research report at `docs/research/pe_design_choices_survey.md`.

Key papers with concrete parameters extracted:
1. **Bilgin & Karimpanal (2024)** — Car-like PE with sensor constraints: 20x20m arena, dt=0.1s, T=500 steps, capture=2*agent_radius, zero-sum reward with lambda_capture=1000
2. **Multi-UAV PE (2024)** — 0.9m radius arena, evader 30% faster (1.3 vs 1.0 m/s), capture=0.3m, T=800 steps
3. **Quadrotor PE (2025)** — 12x12x6m arena, capture=0.5m, T=600 steps (~10s at 62.5Hz), survival reward for evader
4. **MatrixWorld (2023)** — 40x40 grid, capture=+10/-10, movement cost=-0.05/step, 3 co-evolution frameworks
5. **Dog-Sheep (2022)** — Circle R=200, speed ratio range 1 to pi+1, time-out penalty
6. **Multi-agent military PE (2021)** — 20km x 20km, evader faster (1.3 vs 1.0 km/s), capture=1.2km
7. **PettingZoo Simple Tag** — Good agents faster than adversaries, collision=+10/-10, max_cycles=25
8. **OpenAI Hide-and-Seek** — Pure +1/-1 reward, no reward shaping, PPO with self-play autocurriculum

## Files Changed
| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `docs/research/pe_design_choices_survey.md` | Created | Comprehensive survey of PE RL design choices |
| `docs/worklogs/2026-02-26_S54.md` | Created | This worklog |
| `docs/workflow_tracker.md` | Modified | Added S54 entry |

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Document findings as research report | Provides reference for design decisions going forward |
| Focus on papers with concrete parameters | High-level survey papers lack the implementation details we need |

## Issues & Blockers
| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Many papers don't publish exact parameters | Focused on papers with accessible full text and code repos |
| PDF papers can't be parsed via web fetch | Used HTML versions where available |

## Next Steps
- [ ] Review findings against our current design choices
- [ ] Consider whether fundamental changes to arena/speed/reward are needed
- [ ] Potentially redesign game to address trivial equilibrium
