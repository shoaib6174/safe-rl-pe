# Session 8 — 2026-02-22

## Context
- **Phase**: Phase 3 Deep Enhancement (Self-Play Health Monitoring)
- **Branch**: N/A

## Objectives
- [x] Research self-play health monitoring
- [x] Integrate findings into Phase 3 document

## Work Done

### Self-Play Health Monitoring Research
- Conducted deep research on 5 health monitoring topics (25+ sources, SB3-specific)
- Topics: entropy collapse, trajectory diversity, fixed baselines, checkpoint rollback, catastrophic forgetting

### Phase 3 Document Enhancements
- **Section 2.8** (NEW): Self-Play Training Health Monitoring theory
- **Section 3.2** (NEW): 9 health monitoring literature references (OpenAI Five, Ahmed ICML'19, Han NeurIPS'21, PSRO, etc.)
- **Section 4**: Added D9 (health monitoring system); renumbered D10-D16
- **Session 3** (AMS-DRL): Added `SelfPlayHealthMonitor`, `CheckpointManager`, `EntropyMonitorCallback`, `FixedBaselineEvalCallback`, scripted baselines; effort 3-4h -> 5-6h
- **Session 7** (Diversity): Replaced basic k-means with DTW-based `TrajectoryDiversityTracker`, added `OutcomeDiversityTracker`, `CatastrophicForgettingDetector`, `StateSpaceCoverageTracker`; effort 3-4h -> 5-6h
- **Section 6.5** (NEW): Health monitoring parameters config (35+ parameters)
- **Section 6.6** (NEW): TensorBoard monitoring dashboard (10 key metrics with thresholds)
- **Section 7.1**: Added 2 must-pass criteria (health monitoring, no catastrophic forgetting)
- **Section 7.3**: Updated DoD to 9 criteria (added health monitoring, 21 tests)
- **Section 7.4**: Added `test_health_monitoring.py` (6 tests: P-U); total 21 tests across 5 files
- **Section 7.5**: Added 2 worked examples (rollback scenario, forgetting detection)
- **Section 8**: Added 5 new risks (entropy collapse, catastrophic forgetting, strategy cycling, rollback thrashing, DTW speed)
- **Section 9.1**: Added `dtaidistance==2.3.12`, `scipy==1.15.0`
- **Section 9.2**: Added health monitoring reproducibility (points 9-10)
- Fixed section numbering (3.3 duplicate -> 3.3/3.4)
