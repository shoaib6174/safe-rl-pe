# Session 12 — 2026-02-22

## Context
- **Phase**: Phase 1: Simulation Foundation — Session 2 (Observation & Reward Design)
- **Branch**: main

## Objectives
- [x] Validate observation space (14D, normalized)
- [x] Validate reward function (zero-sum, distance shaping, terminal bonuses)
- [x] Validate SingleAgentPEWrapper end-to-end episode loop
- [x] Confirm observation bounds within [-1, 1]

## Work Done

### Validation
- Session 1 already implemented all Session 2 deliverables (observations.py, rewards.py, wrappers.py)
- Ran end-to-end episode validation for both pursuer and evader wrappers
- Confirmed obs shape (14,), values within [-0.94, 0.92]
- Confirmed zero-sum reward property across episode
- All 41 tests continue to pass
